## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a Minecraft server on your VPS or dedicated servers.

This tutorial was tested on **Debian 11**.
Debian 11 is recommended, since it is very light yet very stable. Minecraft can require a lot of RAM, so Debian helps to reduce the memory usage of the overall server. It is easily possible that your Debian server will use less than 80MB of RAM when not running your Minecraft server. The syntax of all commands will be identical on Ubuntu 20.04.

**Prerequisites**

You need the following software before starting:

* `screen`
* `nano` (or your favorite text editor)
* You will also need to install Java.

 **1.8.X -> 1.16.X** `openjdk-8-jre-headless`

 **1.17.X** `openjdk-16-jre-headless`

 **1.18.X** `openjdk-17-jre-headless`

**Getting started:**

We first want to read the repository files and then upgrade our system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
You can install `screen` using this command:

```bash
sudo apt install screen -y
```

And you can install Java using this command, replacing `JAVA` with the one specified above.

Syntax: `sudo apt install JAVA -y`

Example:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
```

## Step 1 - Setting up the user

We first need to create a new user to run our Minecraft server on. The user is required, since it is dangerous to run applications with root permissions. A user will have limited access to most files, drastically increasing the security of your Minecraft server.

You can run this command to create a new user.

```bash
sudo adduser mcserver
```

You will be asked to enter a password. Make sure to choose a secure one! It is recommendable to use a password with 16 characters.

Then, you may leave these empty.

```bash
Changing the user information for mcserver
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: 
	Room Number []: 
	Work Phone []: 
	Home Phone []: 
	Other []: 
```

To login to our new user and go to the home directory of the user, we run:

```bash
su mcserver
cd ~
```

## Step 2 - Setting up files

You need to create a directory for your Minecraft server files. After that, we will change our working directory to this path. Using `&&` allows us to chain 2 commands in one line.

You can do that using the following command:

```bash
mkdir MinecraftServer && cd MinecraftServer
```

---

After you do that, you need to download your server JAR file.

> **Please note:** For security reasons, you should only download your `server.jar` from here: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server.

- **Download it from minecraft.net**
  
  Since there is no permalink visible, we cannot link it here.
  
  At [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), right click on the link in this line:
  
  > Download `minecraft_server.1.18.2.jar` and run it with the following command:
  
  You can now copy the URL with the help of the dialog box.
  
  You should now have a link in your clipboard that looks similar to:

  ```
  https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/c8f83c5655308435b3dcf03c06d9fe8740a77469/server.jar
  ```
  
  You can use this command to download the vanilla server JAR replacing the `VERSION` with the version you want.

  ```bash
  wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/c8f83c5655308435b3dcf03c06d9fe8740a77469/server.jar
  ```

- **Download it from serverjars.com**

  There are performance and stability optimized versions available, for example at https://serverjars.com/

  Unfortunately, it cannot be verified, how secure external sources are. But these can be downloaded in a similar fashion:

  Example:

  ```
  wget -O server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/vanilla/1.18.1
  ```

  If you would like to use Paper, you can run this command replacing the `VERSION` with the version you want:

  ```bash
  wget -O server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/paper/VERSION
  ```

  > **Example:**
  > 
  > ```
  > wget -O server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/paper/1.18.1
  > ```

## Step 3 - Starting your server

After you have created your Minecraft server folder and have your server JAR file in it, you can open a new terminal window with the name `MinecraftServer` using `screen`. You can name it however you like.

```bash
screen -S MinecraftServer
```

Once your screen is started, you need to finally start your server.
You can run this command replacing `<MEMORY\>` to how much RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server in MB. Please do not use all the memory of your system. Always leave a few hundred MB of headroom for your operating system. The cloud server plans CX11 and CPX11 for example have 2GB of RAM, so running a Debian 11 will leave around 1.5G for your Minecraft server to use.

```
java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
```

> **Example:**
>
>  ```bash
>  java -Xms512M -Xmx1536M -jar server.jar
>  ```

You can also replace `server.jar` with your actual server JAR file name that you have in your Minecraft server folder.

> **Example:**
> 
> ```
> java -Xms512M -Xmx4096M -jar I_renamed_server.jar
> ```

Starting your server for the first time will fail because `eula.txt` neither exists, nor was it confirmed. Running the server will create the file. Now you need to edit `eula.txt`.

To do that, simply use the command line editor nano, by running:

```bash
nano eula.txt
```

If you want to run the server, change the line matching `eula=false` to `eula=true` to accept their EULA.

Press `<ctrl>`+`s` to save your changes, and then `<ctrl>`+`x` to exit nano.

Now, start your server again using the same command as the first time.

```
java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
```

Since you are still in a screen, you can exit it by pressing `<ctrl>`+`a` first, followed directly by `<ctrl>`+`d`

If you need to adjust settings later, you can reconnect by first listing the screen, or multiple screens if you created multiple servers:

```bash
screen -ls

There are screens on:
	6312.MinecraftServer	(03/24/2022 09:34:51 AM)	(Detached)
	6309.MinecraftServer2	(03/24/2022 09:34:44 AM)	(Detached)
```

Now note the numbers in front of the MinecraftServer. This is the number you want to use to view the running screen. For example:

```bash
screen -r 6312
```

### Step 3.1 - Joining your server

It is simple to join your Minecraft server!

After starting it, open your local Minecraft client and press `Multiplayer` on the main menu, then `Add Server`. Under "Server Name", type whatever you want so that you can distinguish your server from other servers.

Under "Server Address", you can use your server's IP address to join your server. Example:

```
<ServerIP>
```

If you have changed your server port, you can use this IP:

```
<ServerIP>:<Port>
```

So you would type this for example:

```
203.0.113.1:25565
```

Now press `Done`. By double clicking on the server entry you just created, you should automatically log in to the server.

## Step 4 - Advanced: Auto restart your server

We can create a script to auto restart our server if it crashes. If you are currently the root user, change to your Minecraft user and go to the directory of your `server.jar`, as before. List the screens, and then go back to your screen:

```bash
su mcserver
cd ~
cd MinecraftServer
screen -ls
screen -r <screen-ID>
```

If it is running, you can stop your Minecraft server using the `stop` command.

After that, run:

```bash
nano run.sh
```

After running this command, copy this script, paste it, and then adjust the parameters as required:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
	java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
    for i in 3 2 1; do
    	echo "The server will restart in $i second(s), CTRL-C to cancel."
        sleep 1
    done
done
```

Don't forget to replace `<MEMORY>` to how much RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server in MB.

After that, press `<ctrl>`+`s` to save the file, then `<ctrl>`+`x` to exit.

To make your script executable, run this command:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

This will add the executable flag to the file's permissions. In Linux, this is required for all executable files.

And finally, run `run.sh` and your server will auto restart.

```bash
./run.sh
```

To exit your screen, press `<ctrl>`+`a` and `<ctrl>`+`d`.

## Step 5 - Professional: Tuning your server to the max.

You can configure some Java settings.

- **Overall Memory Requirement**

  If you want to run a large server with many players, you might need more RAM. This table can help you find a recommendation.
  
  | Players | Recommended RAM |
  | ------- | --------------- |
  | 1-5     | 1GB             |
  | 6-10    | 1.5GB           |
  | 11-15   | 2GB             |
  | 16-20   | 2.5GB           |
  | 21-25   | 3GB             |
  | 26-30   | 4GB             |
  | 31-40   | 5GB             |
  | 41-60   | 6GB             |
  | 61-80   | 7GB             |
  | 81-100  | 8GB             |

  The column `Recommended RAM` holds the value you should paste to your java command:

  ```
  java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
  ```

  You can also use `G` on the `-Xmx` Parameter: `-Xmx8G` 

<br>

- **Garbage Collection and Performance Optimization**

  There are a lot of parameters that can optimize the performance of your Minecraft server running on Java. These are all related to the garbage collection of the Java runtime. Older garbage collectors used to be very complicated to tune, but ZGC is becoming more common and well known. It is much more advanced, yet simpler to tune than older garbage collectors due to far fewer parameters. It is also optimized for lower latency. ZGC is NUMA aware, which results in Java trying to allocate memory to the NUMA local memory. It is already activated by default.

  Let's start with a very simple command, which should suffice for 5 players, for example. This is what you could use on the Hetzner Cloud server CPX11:

  ```
  java -Xmx1024M -jar server.jar -nogui
  ```

  Now let us see, what options we have:

  ```bash
  -Xmx<MEMORY>                      # Sets max Heap size of Java VM
  -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions  # Required to tweak some Garbage Collection options
  -XX:ConcGCThreads=2               # Sets the concurrent threads used for garbage collection, not required
  -XX:-UseParallelGC                # Disables old Garbage Collection methods
  -XX:-UseG1GC                      # Disables old Garbage Collection methods
  -XX:+UseZGC                       # Enables new ZGC Garbage Collection method
  -XX:GCTimeRatio=99                # Sets Ratio of Program vs GC time. 99 default. Lower, if server cannot handle memory garbage.
  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50           # Tries to finish Garbage collection within 50 milliseconds
  -jar server.jar                   # Open specific file
  --nogui                           # Disable GUI (minecraft server parameter) 
  ```

Let's pretend we want to play with more people. A cloud server with the server plan CPX31 has 8GB of RAM, so we would expect to be able to play with over 80 people. This will not work on a cloud server with vanilla Minecraft since it does not handle multithreading well at all and we are not using cores with very high clock speeds either. We need to adjust some parameters and use a different Minecraft server jar. This is what all the providers of those huge servers are doing. They use Paper Minecraft, for example. We will also pretend, that we want to use a mod that is not built properly and would not work with memory access protection. We will use 7.5GB for this server:

```
java -Xmx7680M -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:ConcGCThreads=2 -XX:-UseParallelGC -XX:-UseG1GC -XX:+UseZGC -XX:GCTimeRatio=99 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -jar paper.jar --nogui
```

## Step 6 - Comparison and testing

You can now compare different parameters on Vanilla Minecraft on JDK 17.

### Step 6.1 - Testing with server.jar

A quick comparison shows different render times for different JVM RAM sizes with Debian (very light):

Baseline: All servers used the same map seed and had no other services running in the background. Please consider running your own tests under load, since map generation is not the only important thing.
Seed: `8145144813194222318`

**Conclusion:**

As we can see, the spread with Minecraft Paper Server narrows down significantly, as well as the overall server preparation. But the benefits to paper are far bigger:
- Control the performance by limiting dynamic entities on the server to a given count
- Control the performance by disabling certain events
- Drastically improve the performance by code optimizations regarding multi-thread usage, both for player handling and garbage collection

We can also see that flags do not improve the rendering time of the world. However, the real benefit comes down to lag spikes in game. This effect is very hard to measure, but vanilla Minecraft with no flags or even with ZGC flags will likely perform much worse than both servers setup with ShenandoahGC and Aikar flags.

## Step 7 - Tips and tricks (optional step)

This section contains a list of commands which are often combining multiple commands. Please use them at your own risk or know what you are doing first.

- **Remove files**

  If world/server creation failed and needs to be redone, remove all files of the current directory, except for `server.jar`, `server.properties` and `eula.txt`:
  
  ```
  rm -vR !('server.jar'|'server.properties'|'eula.txt')
  ```
  
  This can be especially helpful, if you want to regenerate the same world over and over to check the rendering time of the world using different parameters.

- **Find a good seed and use it on a server**

  You can generate a seed for your current Minecraft version on this external link:

  https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map

  Open your config before creating a new world: `nano server.properties` and edit the line `level-seed=your_level_seed_here`

  Be sure to donate for chunkbase if you use their service.

- **Create a swap file**

  Create a small swap file if you want to go to the limit with your RAM usage for the server.

  A Java VM can exceed the memory available and will crash if no more bytes are free to allocate to it. Swap will be very slow and cannot be used as RAM, but it can help to prevent a crash. So as a very quick and dirty method you can create 1GB of swap within the root directory with the following command (run as root!):

  ```bash
  fallocate -l 1G /swapfile; chmod 600 /swapfile; mkswap /swapfile; swapon /swapfile; echo "/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab; echo "Successfully performed all actions and created a persistent Swap file"
  ```

  If every step worked correctly, you should see this message:

  ```
  Successfully performed all actions and created a persistent Swap file
  ```
  
  The swap file works after a reboot. Do not run it twice, since double entries in `/etc/fstab` could make the system unbootable.

- **Reset swap, so that the usage is 0**

  If you want to tweak the Xmx settings of your Minecraft server, you might want to monitor the swap usage. If you need to run a test and it requires your swap to be completely empty, simply run the following command and swap will get set again.

  ```bash
  swapoff -a; swapon -a;
  ```

- **Deploy a standard nftables firewall on Debian**

  You can deploy and activate a nftables firewall to only accept SSH port 22 and Minecraft port 25565 with the following commands:

  - Write to the `/etc/nftables.conf` file
  
    > **Please note:** This will overwrite the existing `nftables.conf`! If you have any other rules applied, those will get lost.

    ```bash
    cat > /etc/nftables.conf << EOF
    #!/usr/sbin/nft -f
    
    flush ruleset
    
    table inet filter {
            chain input {
                    type filter hook input priority 0;
                    iif lo accept
                    ct state established,related accept
                    tcp dport { 22, 25565 } ct state new accept
                    ip protocol icmp icmp type { echo-request } accept
                    ip6 nexthdr icmpv6 icmpv6 type { nd-neighbor-solicit,  nd-router-advert, nd-neighbor-advert } accept
                    counter drop
            }
            chain forward {
                    type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
            }
            chain output {
                    type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
            }
    }
    EOF
    ```

  - Check if the content was added to `/etc/nftables.conf`

    ```
    cat /etc/nftables.conf
    ```

  - Restart and enable nftables

    ```
    systemctl restart nftables && systemctl enable nftables
    ```
  
  Run these commands as root. Basic IPv6 connectivity and ICMP are still activated, but ports cannot simply be scanned anymore. You may adjust the settings as you like. If you want to insert the config using the above command, please ensure to keep the spaces, or the config could fail to load.

- **Deploy fail2ban to protect your SSH further**

  Although SSH keys are recommended and typically very safe, we can further harden the server by banning users performing failed login attempts repeatedly for 5 hours in this case.

  - Install fail2ban

    ```
    apt update && apt install fail2ban -y
    ```

  - Set the ban

    ```
    cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local && sed -i 's/bantime  = 10m/bantime = 5h/' /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```
  
  - Restart and enable fail2ban

    ```
    systemctl restart fail2ban && systemctl enable fail2ban
    ```

  - Check the status

    ```
    systemctl status fail2ban | grep Active
    ```

  If you run these commands as root, fail2ban will be installed and the config will be copied. The bantime will get changed from 10m to 5h. After that, the service will get reloaded and you should see the status of the service. If the status is not `active (running) since...`, you can run `systemctl status fail2ban` to see the error message on which it failed.

## Conclusion

You have created a Minecraft server, and you know how to access its console, and you have successfully joined it.
